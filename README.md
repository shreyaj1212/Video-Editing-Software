Video Editing Software

I hope to help a video editor sort through footage. Mainly for Anvil and/or YouTube videos.

Plan on using https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html library

1. improve sound quality
2. discard footage where nothing is happening (no sound and/or movement)
3. find music that matches footage
